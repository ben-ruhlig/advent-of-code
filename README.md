2024 Challenge - What did I learn each day:
- Day01
    - [Part1](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/1#part1): Sort & Compare two vectors with vector methods `iter`, `zip`, `map`
    - [Part2](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/1#part2): Compare two vectors, result in third. Same as above.
- Day02
    - [Part1](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/2#part1): Iterate through contiguous slices of vector with method `windows`
    - [Part2](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/2#part2): Dealing with `Option` types, and `enumerate` with vectors. Complex Logic. **Could this be done in a more rust friendly?**
